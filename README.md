# Odin Recipes
This is the first project for Odin Project Course.
This time, my current knowledge is the basics of Git and Github, the basics of creating HTML
HTML basics like making head, body, unordered and ordered list, headings, links, etc.
 # Initial - HTML Creation
 What i've done are first created a repository on Github then
 get it clone from my local machine. After that, i make a index.html for the main page of the webpage
 then after that i created 3 recipe page that are link to the main page.
 After i finish the pages, i added all the files and committed it all and then push it to Github.

 After learning some basic of CSS, i create style.css for the main page. Then i also create subpages.css for
 css file for sub pages. The sub pages share one css file while the main page has own css file.
